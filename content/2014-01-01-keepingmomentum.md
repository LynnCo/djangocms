Learning a new skill can be challenging, especially if you're trying to do it solo. You might find yourself motivated for a week, then have trouble moving past something you're stuck on. Here are some ways to keep yourself on track.

### Set a clear goal
Knowing what you're working towards helps keep you focused. Good goals are specific, measureable and realistic. Start small if you're new to programming: your first goal could be anything from writing a simple script to completing an indroductory class on Python. Give yourself a timeframe or deadline to stay on track.

Larger goals are great too, but make sure to identity steps that will help you get there. If your end goal is to get hired as a web developer or build an app, identity skills you'll need to learn and simple projects you can work on to help you get there.

### Apply your knowledge
Learning new languages is awesome, but make sure you're practicing your new skills too. If you're working off of free lecture videos, try finding small projects you can do using the code you're working with. Open up a text editor and follow along by writing code yourself when you're watching lectures or reading. Understanding the practical applications of your work and seeing it come together will help you see the progress you're making and motivate you to stick with it.

### Review
There's a lot to learn out there, and it can be easy to forget something if you're not using it. Take notes or compile resources for reference in a way that's useful to you, so you can refer back if you forget how a particular piece of syntax works. Re-read or skim the notes you have every so often.

### Do a little work each day
It's easier to stick with something if it's a regular part of your routine. Try to work towards your goal every day, even if it's just for 10 or 15 minutes. If you're too tired to learn something new or feel stuck, try reviewing old information or finding new resources to look through later. If you're really busy, you could even think about how to get a project done while you're in the shower or making dinner.

### Know when to ask for help
If you get stuck, don't give up. Check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or a forum specific to the information you're learning to see if your question or issue has been answered. If it hasn't, post about the problem you're having!

You can also reach out to mentors or other professionals for help, especially if you're a member of a meetup or regular get-together of tech people.

### Set up a system for accountability
If you're using free tools to learn programming online, chances are, you're not alone. Use forums on the sites you're learning from, subreddits dedicated to programming or other online communities to find people who will motivate you to stay on track. These people can also act as a resource if you get stuck or have a particularly difficult problem you're working through.

###Use your friends
Even if the people in your life aren't into tech, they can still help keep you on track with your goals. Tell people who have supported you in the past what you're working on and explain why it's important to you. Set up regular times to check in with them and update them on your progress (you can help them with one of their goals too).
