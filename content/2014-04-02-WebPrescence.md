There is a lot of of information about the various ways that online activities can influence potentional career options, but I'm going to speak to things I know to be true for tech.

First though, there is a broad decision you need to make. Do you want to be impossible to find or easy to find?

Impossible to find is straight forward enough ... [link: how to disappear from the internet] and can actually be a benefit if you're trying to work 

Easy to find can be a bit more work. Firstly, you want to have a profile on all of the things that are big at the moment. I can be a bit of a hipster and tend to avoid things that are popular, unless I have an explicit reason to use it, but that is -not- the mindset you want to approach your web prescence with. If you want to be easy to find, then you have to use the most well known tools. That being said, here's what I reccomend for right now [April 2014]

level 1: yourname@gmail.com, facebook or twitter, linkedin
level 2: facebook -and- twitter, google plus, github, skype
level 3: blog (tumblr or wordpress), about.me/yourname (or similar), IRC
level 4: yourname.com or yourname.me, blog.yourname or yourname/blog
level 5: contact@yourname.me

Higher levels make you more awesome. Level 4 and above is going to cost you money though. In my acqiusition of these things, there are two rules that I follow:

* Consistency and content awareness for information you want publically attributed to you
* Randomness and access awareness for information that you don't

Breaking that down, consistency is about having some aspect of your presentation be consistent across all media. Example:

facebook.com/lcyrin (is that the actual link???), lynncyrin.me, lynncyrin@gmail.com

That's my first name [lynn], last name [cyrin]. Do note though, that's not my legal last name. If there's something about your last name that you dislike, feel free not to use it in your web persona. The only people that are going to need it are human resources / the government / people who are doing things that involve giving you money in some ways. You also don't need it to be first name, last name, particular so if your name combination is fairly common. Feel free to use any sort of psuedonym, EX:

There's also the issue of you yourself being aware of what things you are attributing to your public persona.
