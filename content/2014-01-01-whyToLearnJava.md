### The language of Android

If you plan to write an app or game for Android mobile phones, you will almost certainly be writing that app in Java. It's possible to write Android apps in other languages, but Java is by far the most common. All of the useful stuff that Google provides to help your app interact with the Android system is most readily available from Java code.

### Popular for writing programs for a big datacenter

For various reasons, Java is a popular choice when writing code that needs to run on many machines in a data center. For these uses (called 'distributed systems'), Java is generally more efficient than higher-level languages like Ruby or Python, but easier to use and less error-prone than lower-level languages like C. Many of the larger Internet companies, like Google, Amazon, and Twitter use Java for their most resource-intensive services. The growing field of `big data,' which analyzes millions of pieces of information using hundreds of machines, also typically uses Java.

### Lots of useful tools

Often you want to make your program to do some common task, like securely store a password or crop an image to a certain size. If you're lucky, another programmer has already written that code and shared it as a unit (called a `library') so you can easily use their code. These libraries are generally programming language-specific. Since Java has been around so long, and is so popular, there are a tremendous number of libraries you can use with it for just about any task.

### Big traditional business uses Java

Even companies that aren't based around the Internet, like banks, airlines, and manufacturers, employ programmers to create their computer infrastructure. For many of the largest businesses, their language of choice is Java, because it has been around a long time, is very stable, and runs on many platforms. This means that, outside of startup hot spots like San Francisco and New York, many of the programming jobs available are for Java programmers.

### Disadvantages

Compared to higher-level languages like Ruby or Python, Java can be more challenging and time-consuming to write. The popular modern style of `functional programming,' which makes chaining together small blocks of code easier, is difficult to use in Java. And for beginners, remembering the semicolon for every line, remembering all the right import statement, and correctly setting the type on all variables can be a stumbling block.
