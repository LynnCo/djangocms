<h3>Finding opportunities</h3>

**Where is the money?**

The important thing to understand is that ultimately money comes from knowledge and connections. Like money, these are not distributed evenly, but there is almost always something you can do about that. I’ve had to start from scratch several times over my career, so by now I’ve worked out a process for dealing with it that I will describe here.

My first step is always to find out more about what is going on in the world and where the opportunities have gone. There is always some tool that lots of people are using to organize events. In 1990 it was local newspapers, in 1997 it was craigslist.org, in 2004 it was Yahoo email lists and as of early 2014, it is Meetup and Eventbrite. Large cities will have dozens or hundreds of free events listed on these sites and smaller ones will have at least a handful. 


Go to as many events as you can and watch the people there. This will probably be uncomfortable. Watch the people there carefully:<ul>
<li>Are they friendly or not?</li>
<li>Is there a sense of plenty here or not? </li>
<li>Is there a sense of energy and excitement here or not? </li></ul>
You’re looking for communities that are friendly, energetic, and generous. Energetic and generous are more important than friendly, since unfriendliness is easier to overcome than stinginess and lack of energy. Also, selfish or sad communities tend to have a lot of bad luck. 


Make small talk with people and collect as much information as possible:<ul>
<li>What kind of work are these people doing?</li>
<li>Does it pay well?</li>
<li>Do they like it? </li>
<li>Are they optimistic about their professional future? </li></ul>
You’re looking for something that can support you and also will still be around after you’ve done what you need to do to get these jobs because that can take a while.
