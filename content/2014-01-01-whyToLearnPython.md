Python is a free language that happens to be very easy to learn. It is simple, yet quite powerful and the syntax is easy to master. People will often tell you that syntax is not a problem and that one should not be bothered with it. On the contrary, for a beginner, the missing semicolon that causes the entire program to crash might be very intimidating. Python commands are close to English, therefore, easy to get used to. It is quick to write and easy to visualize. Many big, giant companies want you to have Python skills. In addition, there are many free tutorials and eBooks that you can rely on.
